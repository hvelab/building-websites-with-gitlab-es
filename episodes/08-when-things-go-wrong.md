## When Things Go Wrong

So far we have seen how to successfully use various technologies to produce a website.
There are however some situations where they may fail to do so either due to a typo or missing information. We will go
through one of these cases with a Jekyll example.

If you were keeping an eye on the GitLab pipeline execution page until now (`CI/CD > Pipelines`), you may have noticed
that the once you push the pipeline results "pending", then it starts "running", and eventually it "passes".
Eventually. If it doesn't, then the status is "failed", you may receive an email about it (depending on your GitLab account settings) and you shouldn't panic.
How can we instead understand what caused the error, and fix it? The "failed" status happens to be a button, let's click it.

![click on the failed button to access the pipeline log](../fig/gitlab-error.png)

Once again, you can click on the ❌ <span style="color:red">pages</span> button to access more details, i.e. the
complete log of our pipeline execution. Scroll up the terminal-like window to see how it started, prepared the
environments, installed dependencies and correctly executed until the command `bundle exec jekyll build - public`.
Remember that? It is the command that launches Jekyll, we included it in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

Based on this, we have reasons to suspect that the error here is related to Jekyll being unable to build the page.
Reading more carefully in order to get more details, we find:

~~~
$ bundle exec jekyll build -d public
                    ------------------------------------------------
      Jekyll 4.2.1   Please append `--trace` to the `build` command
                     for any additional information or backtrace.
                    ------------------------------------------------
/usr/local/bundle/gems/safe_yaml-1.0.5/lib/safe_yaml/load.rb:143:in `parse': (/builds/hpg_ToyM/0/grp-bio-it/template-pages-jekyll/_config.yml): could not find expected ':' while scanning a simple key at line 3 column 1 (Psych::SyntaxError)
~~~
{: .language-bash }

This means two things: first, the log suggests a way to eventually get more details, i.e. to modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml`
file by adding `--trace` to the command `bundle exec jekyll build -d public`, that thus becomes
`bundle exec jekyll build -d public --trace`. However, we don't really need that: the next sentence is clear enough.
It says, there was an error in parsing the `_config.yml` file because Jekyll could not find the expected `:` character.
Since this typo prevents Jekyll from building the page, the process cannot continue.

> ## Failure Will Not Remove Your Website
>
> Given the failure you may be wondering what happened to the website?
> If you visit the address you will find that the website is still be available.
>
> GitLab will keep your previous version online until the error is fixed
> and a new build is completed successfully.
{: .callout }

We should go back to our `_config.yml` file and fix the `=` error we made (on purpose, this time).
Then push the project again, and problem solved!

> ## Exercise: Practice With Troubleshooting Jekyll

> Sometimes typos happen and can make your website change in surprising ways.

>
> Try the changes listed below on your `index.md` file and see what happens when the page renders.
> You will want to correct the previous mistake each time.
> 1. Use a global or local variable that you didn't define first.
> 2. Leave the dash off the end of the YAML header.
> 3. Don't put a space between the YAML header and the rest of the page
> 4. Put the YAML header in a different location in the page.
