[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is a tool to generate webpages or PDF, mainly designed to create a
project documentation. It was originally created for the Python documentation, but it has excellent facilities for
the documentation of software projects in a range of languages. Polyglot documentation systems might be very useful
in case your project increases in complexity or number of collaborators, so take a note about this.

In this chapter of the lesson we will use Python programming language. Even if this is not strictly necessary,
we suggest you to familiarise with Python - as explaining it falls outside the purpose of this lesson.
You can choose to do so by going through The Carpentries lesson
[Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).

> ## Exercise: Documentation
> In a group, have each member open one of the following packages' documentation
> - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
> - [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
> - [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/)
> - [scipy-cookbook](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/)
> - [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
>
> Discuss what the common components are, what is helpful about these
> documentation sites, how they address the general concepts on documentation,
> how they're similar and how they're different.

While Jekyll converts Markdown files (`.md`) into HTML, Sphinx converts reStructureText files (`.rts`). While these two
formats might seem very similar at a first glance, they were created for two different purposes: Markdown to write for
the web, reStructuredText to write documentation.
[This blog post](https://www.zverovich.net/2016/06/16/rst-vs-markdown.html) provides more insights about what this means
in practice, the most important point that we would like to highlight in this context is that reStructuredText is
well-suited for the conversion to PDF too. This makes it a useful tool also for the development of documents you may
need both online and in paper copies, for example training materials or a meeting agenda.

> ## Sphinx quickstart
> In sake of clarity, the next steps of this chapter will only focus on Sphinx files that are relevant for the
> HTML files generation. However, by installing Sphinx locally you can run the quickstart command to init a basic
> Sphinx project. We highly recommend this option if you would like to further your understanding of how to document
> with Sphinx. To this aim, we report here the necessary steps.
>
> Your system probably has Sphinx already installed. Check if so by typing in your terminal:
>
>~~~
>sphinx-build --version
>~~~
>{: .language-bash }
>
>If it isn't, you will be able to installing by typing:
>
>~~~
>pip install -U sphinx
>~~~
>{: .language-bash }
>
>Or check more detailed installation instructions [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html).
> Once Sphinx is installed, we can run the quickstart command to get an overview of the minimal set of files that are
necessary to build the documentation. The following command will create an empty repository and run this command there:
>
>~~~
>mkdir sphinx-quickstart-test
>cd sphinx-quickstart-test
>sphinx-quickstart
>...
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]:
>...
> Project name: My project
> Author name(s): <Your name>
> Project release []:
>...
> Project language [en]:
>~~~
>{: .language-bash }
>
>Several documents will be generated. Here an overview:
>
>![Sphinx quickstart](../fig/sphinx-quickstart.png){: .image-with-shadow width="600px" }
>
> The files that are relevant to us in this context are the `index.rst` file - that is the equivalent of our `index.md`
file in the example with Jekyll - and the `conf.py` file. This is why the lesson goes through them only.

Create an empty project folder. Let's initialise our `index.rst` file in our project's root folder.

~~~
.. this is a comment, it is not rendered

Sphinx Example Project's documentation
======================================

Contents:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
~~~
{: .language-markdown }

It reports our project main heading, and then a table of contents through the "TOC tree". A numeric maxdepth option
may be given (we initalised it at 2) to indicate the depth of the tree; by default, all levels are included. More about
Toc tree at [this link](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html). In short, when
adding *.rst files to our table of content, they should be listed here. Let's add a file to see how this works.

Create a `about.rst` file, also in the main root folder, with the content:

~~~
About
=====

Hello, this is the about page of my project.
~~~
{: .language-markdown }

Now let's add this file to the TOC tree by editing the `index.rst` file:

~~~
.. this is a comment, it is not rendered

Sphinx Example Project's documentation
======================================

Contents:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    about.rst
~~~
{: .language-markdown }

That's it: our home page (generate with the `index.rst` file) will now link to the About page (`about.rst`). Next,
let's write a minimal `conf.py` file, also in the root directory.

~~~
# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'My project'
copyright = '2021, <Your name>'
author = '<Your name>'
release = '1.0'

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

html_theme = 'alabaster'
~~~
{: .language-bash }

For a full list of options that can be specified in this file, check the
[documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html).

> ## Sphinx quickstart
> Once again, having Sphinx locally installed will support you through the next stages. Indeed, you can build
> your documentation website locally through the command `sphinx-build . build/` to be run in your root folder.
> Once run, it will generate your output website in the `build/` folder. You can visualize it simply by opening the
> `index.html` file through your favourite browser.

Also in this case, the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is necessary to specify instructions for GitLab deployment. Fill it with:

~~~
pages:
  stage: deploy
  image: python:3.6
  script:
    - pip install -U sphinx
    - sphinx-build -b html . public
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
~~~
{: .language-yaml }

This script: specifies the container for our pipeline (Python, version 3.6), installs Sphinx through
[Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), run the command `sphinx-build` - that builds HTML files in the root folder (`.`)
to a `public` folder that it also creates. Finally, it specifies where to find the HTML artifacts (in the `public`
folder indeed).

That's all set. Now we should once again follow the "Setting up a project" in the
[introduction](https://grp-bio-it-workshops.embl-community.io/building-websites-with-gitlab/01-introduction/index.html)
to set up a remote project in GitLab, set it as remote for our local folder with `git remote add origin <git URL>`,
`git add . && git commit -m <message>` and then `git push -u`. Finally, monitor your pipeline execution and check the
final result.
